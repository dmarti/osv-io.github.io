We are working on the following directions in OSv:

- Adding support for more hypervisors - we currently support Xen and KVM, but VMware is an important target for us

- Optimizing the core kernel

- Integrating with the Java Virtual Machine

- Improving manageability: shell, REST API

- Improving ease-of-deployment, aka Platform as a Service (PaaS) features

- Porting to other architectures, such as POWER and ARMv8
