title: Rapid VM build and deploy
---

OS<sup>v</sup> provides a low-overhead way to build and deploy VM images for your application using the Capstan build tool.  Now, creating an entire VM image adds only 12-20MB and about three seconds of build time over the application's own build, with a corresponding reduction in deployment time.  Best of all, Capstan needs only a few lines of configuration.  <a href="/capstan/">Learn more about Capstan.</a>
