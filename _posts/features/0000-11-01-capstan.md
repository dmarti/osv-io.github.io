title: Rapid VM builds
---

OS<sup>v</sup> is an extremely low-overhead way to build a VM image to run your application, thanks to our Capstan build tool.  Now, creating an entire VM image adds only 12-20MB and about three seconds of build time over the application's own build.  Best of all, Capstan needs only a few lines of configuration.  <a href="/capstan/">Learn more about Capstan.</a>
