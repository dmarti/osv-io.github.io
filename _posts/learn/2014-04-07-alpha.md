## OSv “Val Thorens” 0.06 Alpha Release
This is the first of a series of Alpha (unstable) releases.
OSv is a new lightweight OS, designed from the ground up to run in a
virtual cloud environment, with maximum performance, low latency, and
simple management.

This release focuses on cloud platform enablement,  performance and
administration.

## New Features

### Capstan
Capstan is a tool for rapidly building and running your application on OSv. Capstan is as simple and fast as using Docker for creating containers, but the result is a complete virtual machine image that will run on any hypervisor with OSv support. A typical Capstan image is very lightweight: only 12-20MB larger than your application itself!
Capstan is currently available on Linux and Mac, and can run VM
locally or on GCE (EC2 comi soon)

More on Capstan [here](http://osv.io/capstan/)

### REST API
On a cloud environment of multiple instances, interacting with each instance via GUI or CLI is non efficient. Instead OS operations should allows easy automation. The new REST API for OSv will allow such remote automation.

In this release we expose the first (small) set of REST APIs, with many more to follow.
[Swagger](http://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/) is used to define the REST specification, allowing easy development of client applications and providing  interactive documentation.
The REST API includes the following parts:
* Native HTTP server
* Built-in tool for Swagger API compilation
* UI page for interacting with the API

With the availability of the REST API and the Swagger-UI, we are deprecating the old JRuby base UI.


More on using the API [here](https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/wiki/The-RESTful-API)

Latest API specs [here](http://osv.io/api/swagger-ui/dist/index.html)

### Hypervisor Enablement

In this release, we are introducing an experimental support for three additional platforms:

- Google Compute Engine (GCE)
OSv is now functional on GCE, including support for key-pair authentication.
More on how to run OSv on GCE [here](https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/wiki/Running-OSv-on-Google-Compute-Engine)

- VirtualBox
OSv is now functional on VirtualBox, bringing OSv images for the first time to developers on Mac and Windows machines.  
You can use either download as a ready to use OVF file, or even easier, use Capstan to run VirtualBox for you.
More on how to run OSv with VirtualBox [here](https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/wiki/Running-OSv-on-VirtualBox)

- VMWare 
OSv is now functional on VMWare Player/Workstation/Fusion and VMware ESXi
More information on running OSv on VMWare:
[workstation](https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/wiki/Running-OSv-on-VMware-Workstation%2C-Fusion-and-Player), [ESXi](https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/wiki/Running-OSv-on-VMware-ESXi)

- EC2 
OSv is enabled on EC2 for some time now. In this release it became
functional on a micro instance as well, making OSv available on ALL
EC2 instance types.
More information on running OSv on EC2 [here](https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/wiki/Running-OSv-on-EC2)

### Porting to other architectures
The AArch64 Port of OSv has been started, initially targeting the QEMU Mach-virt platform, running on the ARM Foundation Model v8.

More on ARM port [here](https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/wiki/AArch64)

### Net Channels 
Envisioned by Van Jacobson in 2006, the net channels design radically changes the way an OS handles TCP/IP, in order to take advantage of modern multicore architectures.
The idea, in short, is moving most of the packet processing logic from the kernel to the application context. A minimal packet classifier feeds packet directly to the application socket over “channels”.
The net channel design reduces cache contention and lock contention. In the long term, we expect Net Channels to outperform general OS implementations.

### JVM Balloon
One of the problem with working with the JVM, is that it forces you to set the heap size in advance.
Choose too little and you are hurting your Java app performance.
Choose too much and you are wasting OS resources.
The JVM balloon solves this problem by dynamically exchanging memory between the JVM and OSv, eliminating the need for this manual tuning exercise. 


### ZFS ARC
Added support to allow read-only direct use of ARC buffers on memory mappings, thus avoiding duplication of file data. Write support to ARC buffers is planned. Therefore, writes on file-backed mappings still require the Copy-on-write (COW) approach.

### Driver Enablement
We continue to add more driver alternatives to OSv. 
The latest additions are:

* Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) SATA block driver

* VMW Virtual Network Adaptor (VMXNET3)

More on OSv driver support [here](https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/wiki/Supported-Drivers)


## Appliances
We are constantly looking to improve the usability and performance of OSv base appliances.
In this release, we introduce a new, written from scratch, prototype implementation of memcached. 
Although still in early phase, and not fully functional yet, it
already outperforms memcached on Linux by almost **300%** !

More on memcached prototype and benchmark
[here](https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/wiki/OSv-Case-Study:-Memcached)



Other appliances do not outperform Linux guest by that much.
Our plans is to boost their performance but the expected gain depends whether they are
CPU or IO bound - improvement is expected for the second.
