## Automatic data collection for the OSv private beta

One of the major goals of the Beta program is to collect real data on OSv usage.  This page describes what information will be collected.

## Full disclosure and user approval

We will provide monitoring-enabled versions only to users enrolled in the beta program.  Beta users consent to monitoring by enrolling.

## Monitoring message at boot

At boot time, you will see the message:

```
This is a beta build of OSv. This version will send a report 
each time it is booted to Cloudius Systems.  For more on "
information collected, how and why it is stored, and how to "
disable reporting, see osv.io/osv-stat
```

## Data reported

 * A randomly generated UUID for each boot

 * Operating system name, always "OSv" (`/os/name`)

 * OSv version

 * Date

 * Total memory

 * Free memory at boot time

 * Command run at boot (`/os/cmdline`)

 * Hypervisor used

 * Processor count, if available

 * JVM version (if installed)


## Questions?

If you are a beta program participant and have any questions on monitoring, please ask your beta manager.  We will review your monitoring stats starting with your second beta call.
