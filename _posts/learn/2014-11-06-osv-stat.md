## All OSv binaries collect and send data at each boot.

We do this to collect usage metrics in order to allocate resources correctly.

If you build OSv from source, the monitoring agent is not enabled by default.

## Monitoring message at boot

At boot time, you will see the message:

```
This is a beta build of OSv. This version will send a report 
each time it is booted to Cloudius Systems.  For more on
information collected, how and why it is stored, and how to 
disable reporting, see osv.io/osv-stat
```

## Data reported

 * A randomly generated UUID for each boot

 * Operating system name, always "OSv" (`/os/name`)

 * OSv version

 * Date

 * Total memory

 * Free memory at boot time

 * Command run at boot (`/os/cmdline`)

 * Hypervisor used

 * Processor count, if available

 * JVM version (if installed)


## Disabling monitoring

You can disable the monitoring system in cloud-init, starting with OSv version 0.15 beta.  Use this configuration:

	monitor-agent:
		enable: false


## Questions?

If you are a beta program participant and have any questions on monitoring, please ask your beta manager.  We will review your monitoring stats starting with your second beta call.
