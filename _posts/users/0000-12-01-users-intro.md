Today’s cloud-based applications run a heavyweight stack: the hypervisor, which divides the hardware resources among virtual machines; the operating system, which divides the virtual machine’s resources among applications; and the application server, which divides the application’s resources among the end users.

Clearly, there is a lot of duplication going on. Each layer adds its own overhead in an attempt to abstract away and hide the problems caused by the lower layer. The result is inefficient and complex.

Enter OSv - the operating system for the cloud. On the one hand, designed and optimized to run on a hypervisor. On the other hand, designed to run an application stack without getting in the way. Designed for the cloud.
