## Java application server (e.g. Tomcat)

The application's run-time environment is completely determined by the application server. The user uploads it once, via a REST API (i.e. from the development environment) and the application runs without further configuration.
C-based application (e.g. MemCacheD, redis, nginx, or MongoDB)

Selected C applications will be ported by OSV developers or third parties. Images containing these applications can be downloaded and deployed as needed, often via a load balancer for automatic scaling.
