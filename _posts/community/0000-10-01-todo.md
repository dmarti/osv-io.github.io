### Want to help?
We are working on the following directions for OSv:

- Optimizing the core kernel

- Integrating with the Java Virtual Machine

- Improving manageability: extending the shell and REST API

- Adding monitoring and logging capabilities

- Improving ease-of-deployment, mostly with
  [Capstan](https://github.com/cloudius-systems/capstan)
  
- Porting more native applications to OSv

- Porting to other architectures, such as POWER and ARMv8

### Not a developer?
Me neither :)
